# Acknowledgements

The creation and development of Safe Init have been inspired and supported by a variety of projects, individuals, and the broader open-source community. This page is dedicated to acknowledging their contributions, insights, and the impact they've had on this project.

## (Open Source) Projects

### Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) has been instrumental in providing error tracking and monitoring capabilities that are essential to Safe Init's functionality. Sentry's robust platform has made it possible to capture, track, and manage exceptions in a way that's both efficient and scalable. The Sentry SDK integration allows Safe Init users to gain deep insights into their application's health and error rates, turning raw data into actionable intelligence.

### Datadog

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) offers comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions that have significantly influenced Safe Init's monitoring and alerting features. Datadog's ability to provide real-time metrics, traces, and logs across applications, infrastructure, and cloud services has been a source of inspiration for integrating similar functionalities within Safe Init, ensuring users have access to advanced monitoring tools directly from their functions.

### Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) has transformed communication within development teams and projects. By integrating Slack notifications into Safe Init, we've enabled teams to stay informed about their application's status and errors in real-time. This feature is designed to enhance collaboration and response times, ensuring teams can address issues promptly.

### structlog

[structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) makes logging in Python more accessible by offering a structured and configurable logging system. Safe Init leverages structlog to provide users with clear, structured logs that are easy to parse and analyze. This enhances the debugging process, making it easier for developers to understand their application's behavior and identify issues.

## Supporting Organizations

### Kalepa

[Kalepa](https://www.kalepa.com) has provided an environment that nurtures innovation and supports the development of tools like Safe Init. Their commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems has been a driving force behind this project. Kalepa's support, in terms of resources and encouragement, has been pivotal in bringing Safe Init to life.

## Development Team

Safe Init was developed by [Maciej "Lupin" Wilczy≈Ñski](https://lupin.pl), who is part of the engineering team at Kalepa. His expertise and dedication to creating robust, efficient solutions have been critical in the development and success of Safe Init. We are thankful for his contributions and the unique perspective he brings to the project.

## Final Thoughts

Creating Safe Init has been a tough, yet incredible journey. The technologies we've integrated, the methodologies we've adopted, and the feedback we've received have all been integral to the project's success. This acknowledgment extends beyond the names and projects mentioned here to include everyone who has influenced the project indirectly through their work, especially in the open-source ecosystem.

We are grateful for the generous sharing of knowledge, tools, and code that has made Safe Init possible. As we continue to develop and improve Safe Init, we look forward to more collaboration, contributions, and engagement from the community. Together, we can make cloud applications more resilient, efficient, and easier to manage.

Thank you to all who have been a part of this project's journey.
